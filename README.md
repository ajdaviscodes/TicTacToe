# TicTacToe

HTML - CSS - JAVASCRIPT

This was my first attempt at a simple Tic Tac Toe game using JavaScript.
This is also my first attempt at a README.md that acually describes the application.


I followed a tutorial for this project and would like to add scorekeeping funtionality to it.

I built this with html divs set to an array.
The app loops through the array checking if the div has been clicked.
If X then no O 
If O then no X 
etc..

I set the winningConditions in JS based on a 3x3 mapping that was commented out.
If either X or O are selected in any of the given winningCondition patterns, that player wins.

the reset button removes the inner text and classes that are active while the button is selected.

I think that pretty much covers it.
